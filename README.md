Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Melis.

I already have 6 years of professional experience in IT. In small to medium sized companies, up to large corporations, I fulfilled various roles in different areas. These included development, consulting, testing and the role of product owner.

In 2022, I finally dared a professional reorientation and completed a boot camp in the area of full-stack web & app development. As part of a final project, I developed my own vision. I implemented this independently starting from the backlog to the definition of user stories to the coding of the functionalities.

Now I am looking forward to new experiences in this area.
