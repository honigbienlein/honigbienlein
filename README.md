Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Melis:bee:

I already have 6 years of professional experience in IT. In small to medium sized companies, up to large corporations, I fulfilled various roles in different areas. These included development, consulting, testing and the role of product owner.

In 2022, I finally dared a professional reorientation and completed a full-stack web & app development boot camp.

Now I am looking forward to new experiences in this area.
